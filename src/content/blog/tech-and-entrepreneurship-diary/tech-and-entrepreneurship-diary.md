# My Tech and Entrepreneurship Diary

## 2025-01-31 - Partnership

After two failed businesses and one (BIBB) that has yet to find its shape, I’ve come to believe that among the many challenges of building a venture, choosing the right business partner is the hardest.

I write this as Diana, my former business partner, has decided to step away to focus on herself and other projects. It was a decision that hurt but one I understood.

Diana brought the UX to UX Driven BI—her expertise helped shape our direction. With her, we pivoted from a store to a platform for uploading CVs and eventually to a blog featuring one of the most popular tools for Power BI. She was also the reason BIBB has no dark patterns and isn’t packed with advertising, ensuring a user-friendly and ethical experience. 

Beyond that, she created the visual identity and cohesive style you experience throughout BIBB, giving it a distinct and polished feel. Her contributions were essential to the journey.

For now, I’m considering going solo, but I won’t be making that decision any time soon, as I need to prepare for a presentation at the Association of Proposal Management Professionals.
